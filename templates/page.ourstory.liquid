            <p class="outStory">Matt and Caleb Johnson have been working together their entire lives. Growing up in a small central Texas town, they spent their summers sitting on overturned buckets in their dad’s auto-body shop, trading hot rod hood ornaments, and staging car-antenna sword fights while dodging sparks from the guys working nearby. There, they learned that if something needed to be fixed, they had to learn how to do it.</p>

            <p class="outStory">One year, Matt got a small MIG welding machine for his birthday and set out to learn how to use it. By 2012, Matt and Caleb were self-taught welders working together in a custom fabrication shop in Austin, TX. Notably, they spent five years building custom barbecue smokers and other fire based cooking devices for some of the biggest names in barbecue.</p>

            <p class="outStory">While focusing on metal fabrication, heat, and smoke, the Johnson brothers came to understand the demands of learning the welding trade, and how to manage a fire. Both require discipline, adaptability, and time. And at the end of the day, you’ve just got to have the heat right.</p>
